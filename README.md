# Weather-App
## Objective
This project builds a weather application that allows users to search for weather conditions based on their location. The app dynamically updates its background and icons according to the current weather conditions.

## Features
1. Location and Weather Search
A search feature allows users to enter a location (city, zip code, etc.).
The app will then display the current weather information for the selected location, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief description (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy).

2. Dynamic Background
The application's background changes based on the current weather conditions.
Sunny: Bright or sunny background.
Cloudy: Cloudy or overcast background.
Rainy: Rainy or stormy background.

3. Weather Icons
Display dynamic weather icons that reflect the current weather condition.
Use distinct icons for sunny, cloudy, and rainy conditions.

4. Responsive Design
Application is responsive and provides a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes.

5. Deployment
Deploy your application to a cloud service (yet to be decided). Will provide the URL to the deployed application once this is achieved.
